<h2>Delivery Engine</h2>
<p>This application is the front-end to a series of applications that, when
	fully implemented, will work together to provide a platform to manage deliveries.
	</p>

	<p>I was inspired to build this set of applications to provide a solution to a set of problems in the
	way our company manages its delivery services. Delivery orders are sent by clients by <i>fax</i> and
 	then entered by hand into Google Calender where they are assigned to drivers and their status is managed
	by the dispatcher. The clients do not know the status of their orders unless they call the office.
	Billing is handled by painstakingly going over the fax orders, manually pricing each delivery, and
	entering the data for each delivery into bookeeping software. All of this is expensive and prone to error
